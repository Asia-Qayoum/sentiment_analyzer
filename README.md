Here’s a complete, well-structured **README.md** for your "Sentiment Analyzer for Short Texts" project in the format you requested, incorporating your key features, tech stack, active project details, and future goals.

# Sentiment Analyzer for Short Texts

A compact, high-accuracy NLP model for real-time analysis of micro-content—including tweets, chat messages, and news headlines.

## 🚀 Active Project
**Sentiment Analyzer for Short Texts**

- **Purpose:**  
  A robust, modular NLP project designed for micro-content sentiment classification (positive/neutral/negative), built as a foundation for future Agentic AI communication systems.

- **Key Features:**
  - 🎯 **High-accuracy classification**: Detects sentiment with strong performance even on short inputs.
  - 🏗️ **Modular architecture**: Easily plugs into larger Agentic AI pipelines and adapts to multiple use cases.
  - 📊 **Visual analytics dashboard**: Provides clear, interpretable results and insights.

- **Tech Stack:**
  - 🐍 **Python**
  - 🤗 **Transformers** (BERT/RoBERTa)
  - 🧮 **PyTorch**
  - 📊 **Streamlit**

*"This project serves as both an NLP exercise and a building block for future Agentic AI communication systems."*

## 🌐 Future Goals

- **Short-Term:**  
  Enhance my Agentic AI toolkit through the AI Skillbridge program

- **Mid-Term:**  
  Explore quantum machine learning hybrid architectures

- **Long-Term:**  
  Develop AI systems that autonomously solve real-world problems

## 💡 Inspiration

Traditional AI follows rules – Agentic AI understands intent. This project is a step toward creating more autonomous, context-aware systems capable of seamless human-AI interaction.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers streamlit scikit-learn
```
